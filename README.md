# Project Title
Udiddit

# Description
This project consists of improving the schema of a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website named "Udiddit".

It is currently using a risky and unreliable Postgres database schema to store the forum posts, discussions, and votes made by their users about different topics.





The project is divided into 3 steps:

Part I - Investigate the existing schema

Part II - Create the DDL for your new schema

Part III - Migrate the provided data (DML, DQL)
